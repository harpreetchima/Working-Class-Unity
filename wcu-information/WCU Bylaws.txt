Such a recommendation must be ratified by a two-thirds majority vote of eligible members at a General Meeting.

The primary ongoing work of Working Class Unity shall be conducted through democratically chosen, membership-led focus campaigns, hereinafter referred to as "campaigns."

Campaigns shall be strategically focused, with specific goals to advance socialism and build power for the working class.

## SECTION 4: CAMPAIGN PRIVILEGES

An adopted campaign signifies a democratically agreed-upon priority of WCU's membership. It represents a collective commitment to specific goals and strategies.

**4.2. Amendments to Campaign Plans:** If a campaign wishes to deviate significantly from the plan that was initially proposed and approved by the membership, the proposed changes must be presented at a General Meeting.

# ARTICLE VIII: SIDE-QUESTS

WCU may engage in a limited range of Side-Quests (non-campaign activities) not subject to the cap on campaigns. These activities will include the three essential functions of administrative work, outreach work, and political education work, to be accomplished by the Steering Committee, Membership Committee, and a delegation. Coordination will be overseen by the Steering Committee. Non-campaign activities may also include a limited range of other actions subject to Membership approval.


These actions may be single events, such as demonstrations, or ongoing work that will not require a significant ongoing commitment of resources by the membership.

## SECTION 1: PROPOSAL OF SIDE-QUESTS

Any member can propose, advocate for, or initiate a Side-Quest that meets the above criteria at any time. Membership is responsible for judging if the activity is better suited for a campaign and should, in this case, vote at a General Meeting either to begin a campaign development working group, which will consist of two members, with the goal of developing the activity into a campaign, or else vote to end the non-campaign activity. In addition, Side-Quests that are not democratically approved, by the Steering Committee or Membership, cannot be represented as a WCU activity to outside groups.


## SECTION 2: DEMOCRATIC APPROVAL OF SIDE-QUESTS

A Side-Quest can gain democratic approval by being brought as a proposal to the Membership at a General Meeting. The proposal will require a simple majority of general meeting attendees.

For urgent actions between General Meetings, any member can bring a proposal to the Membership. The action can be approved with quorum plus one approving the action, or three members in good standing, whichever number is higher. Steering Committee members cannot make up half or majority of the votes.

# ARTICLE IX: COMMITTEES

## SECTION 1: THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE

The Education Committee shall operate under the supervision of the Membership Coordinator. Its responsibilities include overseeing the educational and political activities of the chapter.

## SECTION 2: THE MEMBERSHIP COMMITTEE

The Membership Committee shall be managed by the Membership Coordinator. The committee is responsible for member and non-member outreach, as well as the development and training of members.

## SECTION 3: TEMPORARY WORKING GROUPS

Temporary working groups may be authorized by the Membership at a General Meeting. Such groups should not necessitate a significant, ongoing commitment of resources from the membership.

## SECTION 4: COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP

Except for the Steering Committee and Campaign Leadership Committees, which are entirely elected entities, members can join other committees by attending the respective committee's meetings.

# ARTICLE X: MISCELLANEOUS

## SECTION 1: APPOINTMENT OF AGENTS OR SPECIAL POSITIONS

The Steering Committee may appoint agents, officers, or other specific roles as needed, subject to the approval of the Membership. Appointments shall be made only after a two-thirds ratification at a General Meeting.

Appointed agents, officers, or other roles shall report to the Steering Committee and shall not hold any voting rights or other privileges on the Steering Committee beyond those held by Members. They shall perform their duties as directed by the Steering Committee and in accordance with the goals and objectives of the organization.

## SECTION 2: INDEMNIFICATION

WCU shall, to the extent legally permissible, indemnify each person who may serve or has served as an officer, director, or employee of the corporation against all expenses and liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding arising from their service in such capacity.

No indemnification shall be provided for any person with respect to any matter in which they have been adjudicated to have acted in bad faith or against the best interest of the organization. Any compromise or settlement payment must be approved by a two-third vote of the Steering Committee who are not parties to the proceeding.


## SECTION 3: CHANGES TO THE BYLAWS

Members shall have the power to approve changes to the Bylaws. Amendments to the Bylaws shall be announced to the members one meeting in advance of any vote. Changes may be adopted by a vote of two-thirds of the members present.

3.1. Amendments to Proposed Bylaw Changes: Once a bylaw change has been announced, any member may submit amendments to that proposal. Amendments must be announced to the Membership two weeks before the vote to adopt the proposal. Individual members shall submit their amendments to the Steering Committee, who shall be responsible for announcing them to the general Membership. The Steering Committee may also determine by a vote that a proposed amendment is actually a separate bylaw change, and thus should go through the standard bylaw amendment process. Membership can overrule such a decision from the Steering Committee by a simple majority vote at a General Meeting before the final vote is held.

## SECTION 4: COMPLIANCE WITH IRS GUIDELINES AND STATE REGULATIONS

WCU shall not engage in activity prohibited by the IRS guidelines established for 501(c)(4) organizations or similar rules established by the state of California.

The fiscal year of the organization shall begin on the first day of January and end on the last day of December in each year.

## SECTION 5: DISSOLUTION

WCU may be dissolved by a motion approved by two-thirds of the Steering Committee and confirmed by a two-thirds vote. Both votes must take place at a General Meeting. Upon confirmation of the dissolution, the Steering Committee shall designate an appropriate agent to complete the dissolution of the organization. The designated agent shall be responsible for ensuring that all financial and legal issues are properly resolved and that any remaining assets of the organization are distributed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

## SECTION 6: ACCESS TO MEMBER LISTS

Access to member lists or databases containing identifying information shall be restricted in the following ways:

6.1. Steering Committee Access: The Steering Committee shall have full access to member data.

## SECTION 7: BYLAW REVIEW

Every six months, the Steering Committee shall review the Bylaws, recommend changes, and recommend changes to the Membership Pipeline to clarify knowledge and skills that need to be transferred and delegated.
