Working Class Unity

They Have Their Parties. We Need Our Own Organization.
The bosses and landlords have two political parties. The working class needs a fighting organization of its own. Join us to build a member-run movement in San Joaquin County that wins concrete victories, without the compromises and betrayals of politicians and their wealthy donors.

The Dictatorship of the Wealthy
The Problem


Across San Joaquin, rents rise while our wages stall. Bosses demand more while giving less. Both the Democratic and Republican parties answer to their donors, not to us.

Our political and economic system is not broken; it is working exactly as designed to protect the profits of the wealthy by keeping the rest of us divided and powerless.

We refuse to accept this. We are organizing a mass working-class movement to build the genuine democracy we deserve – one where working people have real control over our lives, our communities, and our economy.

collective, class-conscious power
If you believe in mass organizing over fighting alone, in democracy over monied interests, and in building class-consciousness over supporting the status quo, you are already one of us. There is a war being waged aginst the working class. Join us and fight back.
