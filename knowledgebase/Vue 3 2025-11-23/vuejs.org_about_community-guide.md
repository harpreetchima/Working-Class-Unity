# Community Guide [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#community-guide)

Vue's community is growing incredibly fast and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're ready to join it. So... welcome!

Now we'll answer both what the community can do for you and what you can do for the community.

## Resources [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#resources)

### Code of Conduct [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#code-of-conduct)

Our [Code of Conduct](https://vuejs.org/about/coc) is a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

### Stay in the Know [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#stay-in-the-know)

- Follow our [official Twitter account](https://x.com/vuejs).
- Follow our [team members](https://vuejs.org/about/team) on Twitter or GitHub.
- Follow the [RFC discussions](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs).
- Subscribe to the [official blog](https://blog.vuejs.org/).

### Get Support [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#get-support)

- [Discord Chat](https://discord.com/invite/vue): A place for Vue devs to meet and chat in real time.
- [Forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/): The best place to ask questions and get answers about Vue and its ecosystem.
- [DEV Community](https://dev.to/t/vue): Share and discuss Vue related topics on Dev.to.
- [Meetups](https://events.vuejs.org/meetups): Want to find local Vue enthusiasts like yourself? Interested in becoming a community leader? We have the help and support you need right here!
- [GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs): If you have a bug to report or feature to request, that's what the GitHub issues are for. Please respect the rules specified in each repository's issue template.
- [Twitter Community (unofficial)](https://x.com/i/communities/1516368750634840064): A Twitter community, where you can meet other Vue enthusiasts, get help, or just chat about Vue.

### Explore the Ecosystem [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#explore-the-ecosystem)

- [The Awesome Vue Page](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue): See what other awesome resources have been published by other awesome people.
- [Vue Telescope Explorer](https://vuetelescope.com/explore): Explore websites made with Vue, with insights on what framework / libraries they use.
- [Made with Vue.js](https://madewithvuejs.com/): showcases of projects and libraries made with Vue.
- [The "Show and Tell" Subforum](https://github.com/vuejs/core/discussions/categories/show-and-tell): Another great place to check out what others have built with and for the growing Vue ecosystem.

## What You Can Do [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#what-you-can-do)

### Help Fellow Users [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#help-fellow-users)

Code contribution is not the only form of contribution to the Vue community. Answering a question for a fellow Vue user on Discord or the forum is also considered a valuable contribution.

### Help Triage Issues [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#help-triage-issues)

Triaging an issue means gathering missing information, running the reproduction, verifying the issue's validity, and investigating the cause of the issue.

We receive many issues in [our repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs) every single day. Our bandwidth is limited compared to the amount of users we have, so issue triaging alone can take an enormous amount of effort from the team. By helping us triage the issues, you are helping us become more efficient, allowing us to spend time on higher priority work.

You don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although that would be nice too). Sharing the result of your investigation, for example the commit that led to the bug, can already save us a ton of time.

### Contribute Code [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#contribute-code)

Contributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make.

The Vue core repository provides a [contributing guide](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/.github/contributing.md), which contains pull request guidelines and information regarding build setup and high-level architecture. Other sub-project repositories may also contain its own contribution guide - please make sure to read them before submitting pull requests.

Bug fixes are welcome at any time. For new features, it is best to discuss the use case and implementation details first in the [RFC repo](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions).

### Share (and Build) Your Experience [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#share-and-build-your-experience)

Apart from answering questions and sharing resources in the forum and chat, there are a few other less obvious ways to share and expand what you know:

- **Develop learning materials.** It's often said that the best way to learn is to teach. If there's something interesting you're doing with Vue, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a gist that you share on social media.
- **Watch a repo you care about.** This will send you notifications whenever there's activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features. It's a fantastic way to build expertise so that you're eventually able to help address issues and pull requests.

### Translate Docs [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#translate-docs)

I hope that right now, you're reading this sentence in your preferred language. If not, would you like to help us get there?

See the [Translations guide](https://vuejs.org/translations/) for more details on how you can get involved.

### Become a Community Leader [​](https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide\#become-a-community-leader)

There's a lot you can do to help Vue grow in your community:

- **Present at your local meetup.** Whether it's giving a talk or running a workshop, you can bring a lot of value to your community by helping both new and experienced Vue developers continue to grow.
- **Start your own meetup.** If there's not already a Vue meetup in your area, you can start your own! Use the [resources at events.vuejs.org](https://events.vuejs.org/resources/#getting-started) to help you succeed!
- **Help meetup organizers.** There can never be too much help when it comes to running an event, so offer a hand to help out local organizers to help make every event a success.

If you have any questions on how you can get more involved with your local Vue community, reach out on Twitter at [@vuejs\_events](https://x.com/vuejs_events)!
