# Verify Email

Verify email before accessing surveys

To ensure the credibility of your survey participants and maintain high-quality data, you can require respondents to verify their email before they can view and respond to your Formbricks link surveys. This verification process helps confirm that only participants with valid email addresses can access the survey, enhancing data integrity.

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/verify-email-before-survey\#enabling-email-verification)  **Enabling Email Verification**

This feature, designed for link surveys, can be enabled or disabled directly from the survey editor. Here’s how to activate it:

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/verify-email-before-survey\#steps-to-enable-email-verification)  **Steps to Enable Email Verification**

1. **Open Survey Editor**: Navigate to your link survey in the survey editor where you wish to enable email verification.
2. **Access Settings**: Click on the **`Settings`** tab next to the Questions & Styling tab.
3. **Select Response Options**: Find and select **`Response Options`** to access settings related to survey responses.![Choose a link survey template](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/verify-email-before-survey/step-one.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm&q=85&s=1838e99d5f8cc18adb65c709f9a191cd)

2. **Preview Option**: A “Preview survey questions” option is available for those who are just browsing or curious about the survey content without completing it.
