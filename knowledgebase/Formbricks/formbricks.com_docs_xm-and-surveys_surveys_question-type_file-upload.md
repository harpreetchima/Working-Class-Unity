Question Types

# File Upload

The File Upload question type allows respondents to upload files related to your survey, such as production documents or requirement specifications. It features a title to guide the user on what to upload and an optional description to provide additional context.

**Self-Hosting Requirements**: This question type requires file upload storage to be configured. If you’re
self-hosting Formbricks, make sure to [configure file uploads](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration/file-uploads)
before using this feature.
