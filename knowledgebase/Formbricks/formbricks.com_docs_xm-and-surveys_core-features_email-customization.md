# Email Branding

Branding the emails that are sent to your respondents.

**Self-Hosting Requirements**: Uploading custom organization logos for emails requires file upload storage
to be configured. If you’re self-hosting Formbricks, make sure to [configure file\\
uploads](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration/file-uploads) before using this feature.

Email branding is a white-label feature that allows you to customize the email that is sent to your users. You can upload a logo of your company and use it in the email.

Email branding is part of the Formbricks [Enterprise Edition](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/advanced/license).

Only the Owner and Managers of the organization can modify the logo.
