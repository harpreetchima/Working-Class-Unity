# Improve Trial Conversion

Improve Trial Conversion with Formbricks

When a user doesn’t convert, you want to know why. A micro-survey displayed at exactly the right time gives you a window into understanding the most relevant question: To pay or not to pay?

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr\#purpose)  Purpose

Understanding why free users don’t convert to paid users helps boost revenue. This insight allows you to adjust your offering to encourage more users to upgrade.

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr\#formbricks-approach)  Formbricks Approach

- Ask at exactly the right point in time.
- Ask to understand the problem, don’t ask for solutions.

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr\#installation)  Installation

To display the Trial Conversion Survey in your app you want to proceed as follows:

- Create new Trial Conversion Survey at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/).
- Set up the user action to display survey at right point in time.
- Print it.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr\#is-the-formbricks-widget-running)  Is the Formbricks Widget Running?

We assume you’ve already installed the Formbricks Widget in your web app, as it’s required to display messages and surveys. If not, follow the [Quick Start Guide (takes 15 mins max.)](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/quickstart).

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr\#1-create-new-trial-conversion-survey)  1\. Create new Trial Conversion Survey

If you don’t have an account yet, create one at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/auth/signup)Click on **Create Survey** and select the template, [Improve Trial Conversion](https://formbricks.com/survey-templates/improve-trial-conversion):![Create survey by template](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/0ry2MU6Byjoxjs2P/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr/create-survey.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=0ry2MU6Byjoxjs2P&q=85&s=7cffaf0339c8f22f2a2f81c4a23e1f8e)

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr\#2-optional:-update-questions)  2\. Optional: Update questions

You can update the questions and answer options.![Change text content](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/0ry2MU6Byjoxjs2P/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr/change-text.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=0ry2MU6Byjoxjs2P&q=85&s=229685d8f7a2b1ed8ac804a0f4c8ca49)_Want to change the button color? Adjust it in the project settings!_Save, and move over to the **Audience** tab.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr\#3-pre-segment-your-audience-coming-soon)  3\. Pre-segment your audience (coming soon)

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr\#filter-by-attribute-coming-soon)  Filter by Attribute Coming Soon

We’re working on pre-segmenting users by attributes. This manual will be updated in the coming days.

Pre-segmentation isn’t needed for this survey since you likely want to target all users who cancel their trial. You can use a specific user action, like clicking **Cancel Trial**, to show the survey only to users trying your product.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr\#4-set-up-a-trigger-for-the-trial-conversion-survey:)  4\. Set up a trigger for the Trial Conversion Survey:

How you trigger your survey depends on your product. There are two options:

- **Trigger by Page view:** If you have a page like `/trial-cancelled` for users who cancel their trial subscription, create a user action with the type “Page View.” Select “Limit to specific pages” and apply URL filters with these settings:

![Change text content](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/0ry2MU6Byjoxjs2P/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr/action-pageurl.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=0ry2MU6Byjoxjs2P&q=85&s=ad494800de746741b4910ab1d0365b4b)Whenever a user visits this page, the survey will be displayed ✅

- **Trigger by Button Click:** In a different case, you have a “Cancel Trial” button in your app. You can setup a user Action with the `Inner Text`:
