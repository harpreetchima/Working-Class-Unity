# Link Settings

Customize link titles, descriptions, and preview images to make your survey links more engaging when shared on social media and other platforms.

**Self-Hosting Requirements**: Adding a preview image requires file upload storage to be configured. If
you’re self-hosting Formbricks, make sure to [configure file\\
uploads](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration/file-uploads) before using this feature.

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/link-settings\#what-are-link-settings)  What are Link Settings?

Link Settings allow you to configure the metadata (Open Graph tags) for your survey links, controlling how they appear when shared:

- **Link Title**: The headline that appears when your link is shared
- **Link Description**: A brief description of your survey
- **Preview Image**: A custom image that displays alongside your link preview
