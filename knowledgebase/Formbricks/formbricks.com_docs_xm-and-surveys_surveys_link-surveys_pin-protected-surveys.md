### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/pin-protected-surveys\#benefits-of-pin-protection)  **Benefits of PIN Protection**

- **Enhanced Security**: Protects the survey from unauthorized access, ensuring that only participants with the PIN can enter.
- **Controlled Participation**: Enables you to restrict survey participation to a specific group, such as during a closed testing phase or confidential feedback gathering.
- **Prevents Unwanted Access**: Deters casual browsing and unauthorized attempts to view or complete the survey.

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/pin-protected-surveys\#use-cases)  **Use Cases**

PIN protection is particularly useful in situations where:

- Confidential surveys are being conducted, such as internal company feedback or sensitive research studies.
- Surveys are designed for a specific event or group, and access needs to be controlled.
- You want to limit survey responses to participants who have been explicitly invited or have registered in advance.

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/pin-protected-surveys\#conclusion)  **Conclusion**

Setting up PIN protection for your Formbricks surveys is a straightforward and effective way to ensure that only authorized respondents can access and complete your surveys. This feature adds an additional layer of security and control, making it ideal for managing access to sensitive or exclusive surveys.
