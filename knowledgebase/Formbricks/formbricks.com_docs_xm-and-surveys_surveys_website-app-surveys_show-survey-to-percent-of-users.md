# Survey % of Users

Formbricks allows you to display surveys to only a percentage of your targeted users. This is helpful for surveying on public facing website.

To target specific segments of your audience or manage survey exposure, Formbricks allows you to display surveys to only a random selection of your targeted users.

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/show-survey-to-percent-of-users\#how-to-set-up-percentage-based-visibility)  How to set up percentage-based visibility

1

Open settings in survey editor

In the Survey Editor, click on the **`Settings`** tab

2

Find 'Survey Trigger' card

Locate the ‘Survey Trigger’ card in the settings panel

3

Enable percentage toggle

Find and enable the **`Show Survey to % of Users`** toggle

4

Set percentage

Enter the desired percentage (from 0.01% to 100%) of users to whom the survey will be shown![Set percentage](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/targeting/percentage.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa&q=85&s=9601bea0b932d4cb9b63fd8d267e7b58)

Please note that this feature operates based on mathematical probabilistic
functions, which may result in slight variations in the exact percentage of
users who see the survey.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/show-survey-to-percent-of-users\#example-usage)  **Example Usage**

For instance, if you want to expose your survey to only half of your targeted user base, simply adjust the slider to show the survey to 50% of your users. This functionality allows you to conduct A/B testing or control the rollout of new surveys to gauge initial reactions before a wider release.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/show-survey-to-percent-of-users\#application)  **Application**

It’s effective for:

- **A/B Testing**: Compare different user experiences by showing different surveys or survey variations to different segments of your audience.
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Gradually introduce a new survey to a portion of your users to monitor initial responses and adjust based on feedback before full deployment.
- **Load Management**: Manage server load and response processing by limiting the number of responses collected at any given time.

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/show-survey-to-percent-of-users\#conclusion)  **Conclusion**

Using the **Show Survey to % of Users** feature allows for precise control over who sees your Formbricks surveys, making it an invaluable feature for targeted data collection and user experience management. By adjusting survey visibility settings, you can strategically engage segments of your audience, enhance survey testing phases, and optimize overall survey effectiveness.
