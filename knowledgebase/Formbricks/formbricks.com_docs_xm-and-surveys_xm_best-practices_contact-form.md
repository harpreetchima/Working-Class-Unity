# Contact form

A step-by-step guide to creating a contact form using Formbricks.

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on creating a contact form using Formbricks. Whether you’re just starting out or you’re a seasoned developer, this tutorial will walk you through every step of building an engaging and effective contact form.

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form\#what-we%E2%80%99ll-build)  What We’ll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have created a simple contact form featuring:

- A welcoming introduction.
- Fields for collecting the user’s name and email.
- A question to find out why they’re contacting you.
- A message field for users to share their queries.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form\#setting-up-your-form)  Setting Up Your Form

First, let’s lay the groundwork for your form:

- Head to the Surveys page and click on **New Survey**.
- Select **Start from Scratch** to create a new form.
- In the form editor, click the three dots next to a question, then select **Change Question Type** and choose **Statement (Call to Action)**.

![Toggle button for Statement (Call to Action)](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form/welcome1.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa&q=85&s=1f2932da11bc5a2e397fd132d49e9b70)

- Add a welcoming statement to greet your users and explain the form’s purpose.
- Personalize the greeting to make it inviting and encourage engagement.

A warm welcome sets the tone for your form. Make it friendly to encourage
users to participate.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form\#adding-the-name-field)  Adding the Name Field

Next, let’s capture the user’s name:

- Click **Add Question**.

![Adding a question in Formbricks](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form/add-question.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa&q=85&s=4f25086fe1b63e42f0fc6a580e3ecaa9)

- Enter the prompts for the name field.
- Turn off the **Long Answer** option at the bottom right.
- Adjust any **settings**, such as making the field required.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form\#adding-the-email-field)  Adding the Email Field

Now, let’s add a field to collect the user’s email address:

- Click **Add Question** again.
- Select Email as the input type.
- Enter a prompt for the email field.

![Email field configuration](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form/email-field.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa&q=85&s=6e669c3ec3fb7ef91b4d3c04562667fb)

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form\#adding-a-reason-for-contact)  Adding a Reason for Contact

Let’s now understand why the user is contacting you:

- Click **Add Question** once again.
- Select **Change Question** Type and choose **Single Select**.
- Add the question “Why are you contacting us today?”

![Single Select question configuration](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form/single-select-questionare.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa&q=85&s=f7ba9d0cd28140bf925bb05baab29465)

Predefined options help categorize inquiries, making it easier for you to
respond appropriately.

- Add options like “General Inquiry,” “Support,” and “Feedback.”

![Single Select question configuration](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form/query-form.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa&q=85&s=26f798329a09fdb4a62eaf3f3b94c464)

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form\#adding-a-message-field)  Adding a Message Field

Finally, let’s provide a space for the user’s message:

- Click **Add Question** for the last time.
- Add the question: “Your Message.”
- Set the placeholder text to something like “Please write your message here.”

![Message field configuration](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form/message-field.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa&q=85&s=9dcf6ff4e25d2e5b1a4e2d5a752afd09)

- Consider setting a minimum character count to ensure detailed messages.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form\#finalizing-your-form)  Finalizing Your Form

Once your form is complete, follow these final steps:

- Review and rearrange the questions if necessary.
- Test the form by filling it out as a user.
- Customize the **Thank You** message for submissions.
- Publish the form to get a shareable link.
- Enable submission notifications:  - Go to your Formbricks account settings.
  - Verify your email address.
  - Ensure that **Survey** notifications are enabled.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form\#integrating-the-contact-form-into-your-website)  Integrating the Contact Form into Your Website

After publishing the form, follow these steps to integrate it into your site:

- **Copy the Shareable Link**

![Embed Image configuration](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/contact-form/embed.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=DApr5ZMISC_jbIxa&q=85&s=a40c820a997ebe81bb83be6ab29abbc7)

- Find your form in the Formbricks dashboard, and click Share.
- Select Embed in a Web Page.

- **Embed the Code**  - Copy the provided code and paste it into your website where you want the form to appear.

Note: There is an options toggle button called “Embed Mode.” When enabled, it
updates the `src` to `"?embed=true"` and displays your survey in a minimalist
design, removing padding and background for a cleaner look.

- **Test the Integration**  - Check if the form displays correctly on your site.
  - Submit a test entry to ensure everything works and notifications are received.
