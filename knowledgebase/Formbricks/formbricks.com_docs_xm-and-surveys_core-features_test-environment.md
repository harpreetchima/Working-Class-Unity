# Test Environment

Each project on Formbricks has two environments: a test environment and a production environment. The test environment is used to test your surveys through before they are sent out to your customers.

To clearly separate between test and production data, Formbricks provides two different environments for each project. These environments are completely independent of each other **incl. API keys, project configuration and environment Id’s** used for connecting Formbricks to run in-product surveys.

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/core-features/test-environment\#toggle-between-environments)  Toggle between environments

You can switch between environments from the Website & App Connection settings (Configuration > Website & App Connection). At the top, you’ll see a toggle button that says “Switch to development” (when in production) or “Switch to production” (when in development).

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/core-features/test-environment\#dev-environment-testing)  Dev Environment (Testing)

The development environment is used to test your surveys and project configuration before deploying to production. When you’re in development mode, you’ll see a dark red breadcrumb labeled “development” at the top.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/core-features/test-environment\#production-environment)  Production Environment

The production environment is used to serve your surveys to your respondents.
