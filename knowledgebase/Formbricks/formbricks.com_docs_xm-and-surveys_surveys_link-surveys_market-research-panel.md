# Market Research Panel with Prolific

Formbricks surveys can be integrated with Prolifics participant panel easily. This tutorial walks you through the steps on how to access a pool of over 200.000 participants for your research.

Prolific is a paid service. You need to fund your account to access the pool
of participants. The cost depends on the number of participants you want to
reach and the demographics you’re targeting. You can get an estimate of the
cost with the [Prolific price calculator](https://www.prolific.com/calculator)

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel\#purpose)  Purpose

External research panels are useful when:

- You don’t have access to enough people who match your target audience
- You want to reach a specific demographic
- You want to reach a large number of people quickly

## [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel\#steps-to-follow)  Steps to Follow

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel\#step-1:-add-hidden-fields-to-the-formbricks-survey)  Step 1: Add hidden fields to the Formbricks survey

To be able to attribute a completed answer to a research participant, you need to add hidden fields to your Formbricks survey. To do so, edit your survey and scroll down to the Hidden Fields card.Add three fields with the IDs `PROLIFIC_PID`, `STUDY_ID`, and `SESSION_ID`.![Hidden fields added](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel/hidden-fields.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm&q=85&s=08b3c9f439606b5170db64d2b8561f32)

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel\#step-2:-create-an-account-on-prolific)  Step 2: Create an account on Prolific

Go to [Prolific](https://app.prolific.co/) and create an account.

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel\#step-3:-create-a-study-on-prolific)  Step 3: Create a study on Prolific

Once you’re logged in to Prolific, create a new study.![Create a study on Prolific](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel/create-study.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm&q=85&s=5abd86ef7701a34ac35f607fcf172ea1)

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel\#step-4:-copy-the-formbricks-survey-link-to-the-prolific-study)  Step 4: Copy the Formbricks survey link to the Prolific study

We connect the Formbricks survey with the Prolific study by copying the survey link from Formbricks and pasting it into the Prolific study:![Copy the survey link](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel/copy-survey-link.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm&q=85&s=97d95692cf3e2d4759dcea10811a527b)

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel\#step-5:-choose-url-parameters-for-attribution)  Step 5: Choose URL parameters for attribution

To attribute responses to the correct participant, you need to add URL parameters to the Formbricks survey link. The parameters are `PROLIFIC_PID`, `STUDY_ID`, and `SESSION_ID`, exactly like the hidden fields you added.![Adding URL parameters to the survey](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel/url-parameters.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm&q=85&s=bf1e295db2f7f205ab5448ea7fdcb4b7)

### [​](https://formbricks.com/docs/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel\#step-6:-update-the-formbricks-redirect-url)  Step 6: Update the Formbricks Redirect URL

To ensure that participants are redirected back to Prolific after completing the survey, add the redirect URL provided in the Prolific study setup (e.g. `https://app.prolific.co/submissions/complete?cc=I2PWSFRG`)Copy from Prolific:![Copy redirect URL](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel/redirect-url.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm&q=85&s=7259e073f2a44ef4a86bfd0c0cd8a71f)Set it up as Redirect URL in the Response Options in Formbricks:![Add redirect URL to Formbricks](https://mintcdn.com/formbricks/Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel/redirect-url-formbricks.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=Y0_rk27eZSQCDXfm&q=85&s=0ef41dd4353d3c0d1892c3a60fae7594)
