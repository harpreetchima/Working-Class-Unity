Question Types

# Statement (Call to Action)

The Statement question type allows you to display descriptive information in your survey, such as a message or instruction.

It consists of a title (can be Question or Short Note) and a description, which can be a brief note(realted to CTA) or guideline. Instead of collecting input, this type includes a call to action button for further steps, such as booking an interview call.
