Learn how to migrate from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3 server.

In a built Nuxt 3 application, there is no runtime Nuxt dependency. That means your site will be highly performant, and ultra-slim. But it also means you can no longer hook into runtime Nuxt server hooks.

## [Steps](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/migration/server\#steps)

1. Remove the `render` key in your `nuxt.config`.
2. Any files in `~/server/api` and `~/server/middleware` will be automatically registered; you can remove them from your `serverMiddleware` array.
3. Update any other items in your `serverMiddleware` array to point to files or npm packages directly, rather than using inline functions.
