# Overview

Copy page

Nuxt 3 is a complete rewrite of Nuxt 2, and also based on a new set of underlying technologies.

There are significant changes when migrating a Nuxt 2 app to Nuxt 3, although you can expect migration to become more straightforward as we move toward a stable release.

This migration guide is under progress to align with the development of Nuxt 3.

Some of these significant changes include:

1. Moving from Vue 2 to Vue 3, including defaulting to the Composition API and script setup.
2. Moving from webpack 4 and Babel to Vite or webpack 5 and esbuild.
3. Moving from a runtime Nuxt dependency to a minimal, standalone server compiled with nitropack.

If you need to remain on Nuxt 2, but want to benefit from Nuxt 3 features in Nuxt 2, you can alternatively check out [how to get started with Bridge](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/bridge/overview).
