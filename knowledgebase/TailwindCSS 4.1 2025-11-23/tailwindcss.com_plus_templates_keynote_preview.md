# DeceptiConf - A design conference for the dark side.

The next generation of web users are tech-savvy and suspicious. They know how to use dev tools, they can detect a phishing scam from a mile away, and they certainly aren’t accepting any checks from Western Union.

At DeceptiConf you’ll learn about the latest dark patterns being developed to trick even the smartest visitors, and you’ll learn how to deploy them without ever being detected.
