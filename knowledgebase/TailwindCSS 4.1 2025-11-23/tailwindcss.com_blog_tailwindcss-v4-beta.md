About eight months ago we [open-sourced our progress](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha) on Tailwind CSS v4.0. Hundreds of hours of fixing bugs, soul-crushing backward compatibility work, and troubleshooting Windows CI failures later, I'm excited to finally tag the first public beta release.

As I talked about when we published the first alpha, Tailwind CSS v4.0 is an all-new engine built for performance, and designed for the modern web.

- **Built for performance** — full builds in the new engine are up to 5x faster, and incremental builds are over 100x faster — and measured in microseconds.
- **Unified toolchain** — built-in import handling, vendor prefixing, and syntax transforms, with no additional tooling required.
- **CSS-first configuration** — a reimagined developer experience where you customize and extend the framework directly in CSS instead of a JavaScript configuration file.
- **Designed for the modern web** — built on native cascade layers, wide-gamut colors, and including first-class support for modern CSS features like container queries, `@starting-style`, popovers, and more.

There's so much more to say, but everything you need to get started is in the new beta documentation we published today:
