# Accountingmade simplefor small businesses.

Most bookkeeping software is accurate, but hard to use. We make the opposite trade-off, and hope you don’t get audited.

## Everything you need to run your books.

Well everything you need if you aren’t that picky about minor details like tax compliance.

### Payroll

Keep track of everyone's salaries and whether or not they've been paid. Direct deposit not supported.

### Claim expenses

All of your receipts organized into one place, as long as you don't mind typing in the data by hand.

### VAT handling

We only sell our software to companies who don't deal with VAT at all, so technically we do all the VAT stuff they need.

### Reporting

Easily export your data into an Excel spreadsheet where you can do whatever the hell you want with it.

Keep track of everyone's salaries and whether or not they've been paid. Direct deposit not supported.

## Simplify everyday business tasks.

Because you’d probably be a little confused if we suggested you complicate your everyday business tasks instead.

### Reporting

Stay on top of things with always up-to-date reporting features.

We talked about reporting in the section above but we needed three items here, so mentioning it one more time for posterity.

### Inventory

Never lose track of what’s in stock with accurate inventory tracking.

We don’t offer this as part of our software but that statement is inarguably true. Accurate inventory tracking would help you for sure.

### Contacts

Organize all of your contacts, service providers, and invoices in one place.

This also isn’t actually a feature, it’s just some friendly advice. We definitely recommend that you do this, you’ll feel really organized and professional.

## Frequently asked questions

If you can’t find what you’re looking for, email our support team and if you’re lucky someone will get back to you.

- ### Does TaxPal handle VAT?


Well no, but if you move your company offshore you can probably ignore it.

- ### Can I pay for my subscription via purchase order?


Absolutely, we are happy to take your money in all forms.

- ### How do I apply for a job at TaxPal?


We only hire our customers, so subscribe for a minimum of 6 months and then let’s talk.
- ### What was that testimonial about tax fraud all about?


TaxPal is just a software application, ultimately your books are your responsibility.

- ### TaxPal sounds horrible but why do I still feel compelled to purchase?


This is the power of excellent visual design. You just can’t resist it, no matter how poorly it actually functions.

- ### I found other companies called TaxPal, are you sure you can use this name?


Honestly not sure at all. We haven’t actually incorporated or anything, we just thought it sounded cool and made this website.
- ### How do you generate reports?


You just tell us what data you need a report for, and we get our kids to create beautiful charts for you using only the finest crayons.

- ### Can we expect more inventory features?


In life it’s really better to never expect anything at all.

- ### I lost my password, how do I get into my account?


Send us an email and we will send you a copy of our latest password spreadsheet so you can find your information.
