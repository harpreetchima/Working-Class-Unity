## Dark mode support for application UI and marketing blocks

We've finally added dark mode support for all of the application UI and marketing blocks in Tailwind Plus.

![Dark mode support for Tailwind UI components](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/tailwind-plus-dark-mode.png)

There's now a picker to toggle between light only, dark only and system modes so you can grab the code for whatever setup you need to support.

We've carefully tuned the colors and visual hierarchy to make sure the dark mode experience feels just as polished as the light mode designs. Now you can give your users the dark mode experience they've been asking for, with the same attention to detail you expect from Tailwind Plus.

Check out the [UI blocks](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks) to add dark mode to your projects today.

[July 25, 2025](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2025-07-25)

## Vanilla JavaScript support for UI blocks

We’ve just added vanilla JavaScript support to the HTML snippets in our [UI blocks](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks). This means you no longer need to reach for React or Vue if you want components with full interactivity.

To do this we’ve introduced a brand new UI library called Tailwind Plus Elements, which builds on modern web features like `<dialog>`, `popover`, and custom elements. Just drop in a script tag and you’re good to go.

[![Preview of the new Tailwind Plus Elements library](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/tailwind-plus-elements.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/vanilla-js-support-for-tailwind-plus)

Whether you’re using Rails, Laravel, Svelte, Astro, or plain HTML, you can now use Tailwind Plus components like dropdowns, selects, tabs, popovers, and more, with no extra wiring. Same components, same beautiful design — now framework-agnostic.

To learn more about Tailwind Plus Elements, see our [announcement blog post](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/vanilla-js-support-for-tailwind-plus).

[May 14, 2025](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2025-05-14)

## Compass: A starter kit for online courses

We've just released [Compass](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/compass), a clean and sophisticated starter kit for publishing your own online course, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

[![The new Compass course template](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/templates/compass/preview.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/compass)

This template includes a bunch of interesting tools and technologies, like picture-in-picture video, parsing VTT files into transcripts, and extending Markdown images for dark mode and layout shift.

You can read more about it in our [announcement blog post](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/2025-05-14-compass-course-starter-kit).

[April 4, 2025](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2025-04-04)

## New Catalyst combobox component and auth pages

[Catalyst](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-kit) just got a big update with a brand new [Combobox component](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs/combobox) as well as three new [auth page examples](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs/auth-layout), including a login page, a registration page, and a forgot password page.

![New Catalyst combobox component and auth pages](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/catalyst-combobox-component-and-auth-pages.png)

As always, we've taken a lot of care while building these components to make sure they look great, and are also awesome to work with from a DX perspective.

Check out the [homepage](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-kit) and [documentation](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs) to learn more about Catalyst and get started with it in your projects.

[January 22, 2025](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2025-01-22)

## Tailwind CSS v4.0 support

We've updated all of the examples in Tailwind Plus to support Tailwind CSS v4.0! In the "Code" tab of any component you’ll now find a picker to toggle between v4.0 and v3.4.

![New Tailwind CSS version picker](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/tailwind-css-v4.png)

The differences between versions are very small, but the v4.0 snippets make sure to take advantage of the new features introduced in v4 to simplify the code, and also handle any breaking changes in this release.

See the [announcement post](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4) to learn more about Tailwind CSS v4.0.

[October 25, 2024](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2024-10-25)

## New content section, footers, and feature sections

We just added five new marketing blocks, inspired by some of the ideas we designed for our recent [Radiant template](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/radiant).

[![New content section, footers, and feature sections](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/20241025-new-content-section-footers-and-feature-sections.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/content-sections#component-e112c6098be3cddb51fdefe73581193d)

We've added a brand new [content section](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/content-sections#component-e112c6098be3cddb51fdefe73581193d) with image tiles and stats — perfect for an about page.

There's also a new [feature section](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/feature-sections#component-a942eb436b5cdbccfd682861afe44f06) example with a large screenshot framed by a stylish, glassy border. This example works great when you want to display a prominent screenshot of your app, available in both light and dark versions.

Finally, we've added a new [footer](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/footers#component-6202da7e2ba22afb6dd3e6a3e86ee3b2) example with a prominent call to action for those of you who love big chunky site footers. This too comes in light and dark versions.

[October 3, 2024](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2024-10-03)

## New pricing table example

We just added a huge new pricing section example, with fancy glass pricing cards, a logo cloud, and a full feature comparison table that automatically cleverly switches to tabs on mobile.

[![New pricing table example](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/20241003-new-pricing-table-example.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/pricing#component-d95a835cac90b32aa5d8baa9ec647b59)

As always, we've agonized over all the little details so you don't have to, like fine-tuning all of the breakpoints, getting the semantic markup just right, and making sure everything is accessible to screen readers.

[September 24, 2024](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2024-09-24)

## Bento grids

We just added a brand new [Bento Grids](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/bento-grids) category to our collection of marketing components, with three beautifully designed examples to get you started.

[![New bento grid examples](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/bento-grids-category.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/bento-grids)

These seem to be all the rage right now, and they work great as feature sections on a marketing site.

Give them a shot in your next project — we've designed them with customization in mind, making it really easy to swap out the graphics with your own screenshots without having to sweat all the details yourself.

[September 12, 2024](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2024-09-12)

## Radiant: A beautiful multi-page marketing website for your SaaS business

We've just released [Radiant](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/radiant), a beautiful multi-page SaaS marketing template built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, with a blog powered by Sanity.

[![The new Radiant SaaS marketing template](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/templates/radiant/preview.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/radiant)

We had a lot of fun with the animations on this one, and designed a set of very general purpose interactive marketing components that are easy to adapt for completely different products.

It's also the first time we've tried out a headless CMS in a template, making it a great reference for wiring up a tool like Sanity in your own Tailwind CSS and Next.js projects.

[July 4, 2024](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2024-07-04)

## Improved compatibility with React Server Components

The React examples in Tailwind UI are now easier to use with React Server Components (RSC).

![React Server Components](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/react-server-components.png)

Server components don't support passing functions as props, so anywhere we did that in Tailwind UI you'd need to make the parent a client component, even when that component had no actual interactivity.

Using the new `data-*` state attributes in Headless UI v2.0, we were able to remove all of the render props that we were using to conditionally apply different classes based on the state of the component.

We've also updated any components that _do_ need to be client components to include `'use client'` at the top of the example, so you can copy and paste them into your RSC project and they'll work right away.

[June 21, 2024](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2024-06-21)

## Headless UI v2.1 for React

We've just updated all the React components in Tailwind UI as well as our Next.js templates to use the new data-attribute-based transition API that shipped in [Headless UI v2.1](https://headlessui.com/).

![Headless UI v2.1](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/headless-ui-v2-1.jpg)

See our [announcement post](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/2024-06-21-headless-ui-v2-1) to learn more about this new transition API.

[May 24, 2024](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2024-05-24)

## Catalyst: Application layouts, navigation menus, description lists, and more

We just published the first major update to [Catalyst](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/catalyst) since releasing the development preview, with two new application layouts, navbar and sidebar components, description lists, and more.

[![Catalyst sidebar layout](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/catalyst-application-layouts.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/catalyst)

Here's a complete list of all the new components, available in both JavaScript and TypeScript:

- [Sidebar layout](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs/sidebar-layout)
- [Stacked layout](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs/stacked-layout)
- [Navbar](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs/navbar)
- [Sidebar](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs/sidebar)
- [Description list](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs/description-list)
- [Heading](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs/heading)
- [Divider](https://catalyst.tailwindui.com/docs/divider)

We’re also pumped to share that with the release of [Headless UI v2.0 for React](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/headless-ui-v2), Catalyst is no longer in development preview — it’s officially stable and you can start using it in production today without worrying about breaking changes in the underlying dependencies.

Check out our brand new [live demo site](https://catalyst-demo.tailwindui.com/) to see what a full Catalyst project looks and feels like after these updates for yourself.

[May 23, 2024](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2024-05-23)

## Headless UI v2.0 for React

We've just updated all the React components in Tailwind UI as well as our Next.js templates to use [Headless UI v2.0](https://headlessui.com/), the latest major version of this library that we released just a couple weeks ago.

![Headless UI v2.0](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/headless-ui-v2.jpg)

Headless UI v2.0 is jammed-packed with new features, including built-in anchor positioning, a new checkbox component, combobox list virtualization, and much more. See our [announcement post](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/headless-ui-v2) for all the details.

We recommend upgrading existing Headless UI v1.x projects to this latest version, and have put together a detailed [upgrade guide](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/releases/tag/%40headlessui%2Freact%40v2.0.0#user-content-upgrading-from-v1) explaining what's all changed.

[December 20, 2023](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2023-12-20)

## Introducing Catalyst: A modern application UI kit for React

We just released the first development preview of [Catalyst](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/catalyst), our first fully-componentized, batteries-included application UI kit for React — real components with thoughtfully designed APIs that build on each other to create a real component architecture, the same way we’d do it in a real application.

There’s a lot more to come, but we’re releasing it today so you can play with it right away as we continue to build new components and find ways to make it an even better experience.

[![The new Catalyst UI kit](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/templates/catalyst/preview.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/catalyst)

[September 7, 2023](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2023-09-07)

## Next.js site templates now available in TypeScript

All of our Next.js site [templates](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates) are now available in both JavaScript and TypeScript, so you can choose whichever language is the better fit for you and your team.

[![Tailwind UI templates now available in TypeScript](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/20230907-typescript-templates.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates)

When you download a template, you'll find two folders in the zip file — `/{template}-js` and `/{template}-ts`, each containing the source code for the entire template in the corresponding language.

Each template has been authored with the latest version of TypeScript by nerds who get way too much satisfaction out of getting the types just right, so if TypeScript is your thing, you should find the experience very satisfying.

[July 13, 2023](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2023-07-13)

## Meet Studio: A beautiful new multi-page agency template

We've just released [Studio](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/studio), a beautiful new multi-page agency template built with Tailwind CSS and Next.js. This is our largest template to date, and it takes advantage of the new app router in Next.js.

We really sweat the details with this template, like using Framer Motion to tastefully include subtle animations throughout the template, and MDX to make the case study and blog post authoring experience a great one.

[![The new Studio agency template](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/templates/studio/preview.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/studio)

[April 24, 2023](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2023-04-24)

## All-new application UI pages + huge component update

We just shipped a big application UI refresh that includes totally redesigned page examples, and dozens of updated and brand new components.

[![Collage of new application UI component designs](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/20230424-application-ui-update.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/application-ui/page-examples/home-screens)

The new page examples include both light and dark designs, and also include the highly coveted home screen design everyone has been asking us for after seeing it used as screenshots in some of our new marketing components.

[April 12, 2023](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2023-04-12)

## Introducing Commit: A beautiful new changelog template

We've just released [Commit](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/commit), a beautiful new changelog template built with Tailwind CSS, Next.js, MDX, and a dash of Motion One.

Inspired by plaintext CHANGELOG files, we've built the whole thing in a way that you manage it all from one glorious markdown file — just slap a horizontal rule above your last post and start typing.

[![The new Commit changelog template](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/templates/commit/preview.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/commit)

[April 4, 2023](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2023-04-04)

## All-new marketing page examples + tons of component updates

If you've been watching closely, you might have noticed a lot of "new" badges all over the marketing category the last few weeks.

[![Collage of new marketing component designs](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/20230304-marketing-update.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/pricing)

We decided it was time to give all of the marketing components a fresh coat of paint, starting with all-new designs for all of the page examples:

[January 27, 2023](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2023-01-27)

## New heroes, feature sections, CTAs, and more

We've been busy the last few weeks working on a big batch of fresh marketing components for Tailwind UI, including tons of new hero sections, feature sections, CTAs, and more.

[![Collage of new marketing component designs](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/20230127-marketing-update.png)](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/heroes)

We also spent a bunch of time going through the examples that were already there and gave them a bit of polish — we were pleasantly surprised to discover that yes, we actually have gotten better at design since we released some of these components almost three years ago.

- Updated all examples in the [Hero Sections](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/heroes) category, including 10 new designs

## New Protocol template

## React and Vue support

Today we’re excited to add first class support for React and Vue 3 to all of the examples in Tailwind UI, which makes it even easier to adapt them for your projects.

[![Tailwind UI: Now for React and Vue.](https://tailwindcss.com/plus-assets/img/changelog/react-and-vue-support-banner.jpg)](https://tailwindcss.com/)

It’s been [a long journey](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/building-react-and-vue-support-for-tailwind-ui) but I am super proud of where we ended up on this one, and really think it’s going to make Tailwind UI a useful tool for a whole new group of Tailwind CSS users.

- **Functional and accessible** — all of the React and Vue examples in Tailwind UI are powered [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) which handles all of the ARIA attribute management, keyboard interactions, focus handling, and more for you, while keeping all of that gnarly complexity safely tucked away in your `node_modules` folder where we can make improvements and fix bugs on your behalf, without you ever having to change your own code.
- **Fully customizable** — with Headless UI, we’ve managed to abstract away all of the complicated JS functionality without taking away any control over the actual markup. That means that the entire design is still in entirely under your control, and you can fully customize any example by simply adding and removing utility classes like you’re used to.

All of this stuff is available as a totally free update for Tailwind UI customers. Just log in to your account, select between HTML, React, or Vue in the dropdown above any component, and grab the code in the format you want.

[March 6, 2020](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog#2020-03-06)

## New additions

- Added new [Action Panels](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/application-ui/forms/action-panels) category, with 8 components to start
- Added new [Layout Containers](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/application-ui/layout/containers) category, with 4 components to start
- Added new [Layout Panels](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/application-ui/layout/cards) category, with 10 components to start
- Added two new [Form Layout](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/application-ui/forms/form-layouts) examples _(two-column cards with separate submit actions and two-column in full-width cards)_
- Added a new ["Three-tier with emphasized tier"](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/sections/pricing#component-d91bc5ed1deb87275decb69f70274650) pricing section example
- Added [Marketing Banners](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/marketing/elements/banners), with 4 components _(we had these done on day one but they've been accidentally invisible the whole time due to a configuration typo! Derp.)_
- Fixed focus/active styles for buttons in [Page Headings](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/application-ui/headings/page-headings) and [Card Headings](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/application-ui/headings/card-headings) _(these were slightly inconsistent with the button styles we use elsewhere in Tailwind UI)_
- Tweaked padding on footer of [Modal with gray footer](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/application-ui/overlays/modal-dialogs#component-47a5888a08838ad98779d50878d359b3) component _(we had used `py-4` initially but `py-3` is more consistent)_
- We had `dd` and `dt` elements backwards on our description list components — we've fixed that now!
