Many years ago I got a message from [Steve](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) that said something like:

> Have I ever shared this guy's Dribbble profile with you before? Been following him forever, some of my absolute favorite work I've ever found.

That person was [James McDonald](https://dribbble.com/james), and today we're totally over the moon to share that James is joining our team full-time.

![Examples of James' previous work](https://tailwindcss.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fjames-work.4027b1ff.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

Some of James' awesome work from his [Dribbble profile](https://dribbble.com/james).

James is an incredibly talented UI designer with an amazing eye for tiny details _(they call him [the shadow king](https://dribbble.com/shots/3985645-Newsletter-Sign-Up))_ who is constantly pushing the industry forward and setting new trends while somehow never designing anything that feels trapped in a certain time period. He's also a fantastic [icon designer](https://dribbble.com/shots/14568974-)!

James has been a good friend of ours for a few years now, and we've worked with him on a few different projects over that time, including a bunch of awesome designs he put together for us for [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) when we wanted to add some fresh perspective last year.

![Designs James created for Tailwind UI](https://tailwindcss.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftailwindui-work.5b291081.jpg&w=3840&q=75)

Examples James designed for us for Tailwind UI.

We've been such huge fans of James' work for so long that it's honestly a dream come true to have the chance to work with him on what we're doing with Tailwind CSS, Tailwind UI, Heroicons, and more.

Can't wait to share some of the work we'll be creating together in the months to come!
