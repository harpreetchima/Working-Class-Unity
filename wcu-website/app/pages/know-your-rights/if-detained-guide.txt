# If Detained: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide

### SECTION 1: If You're Reading This Right Now

**Take a deep breath. We will help you.**

But you are not alone. This guide will help you understand what is happening. It will tell you exactly what to do, step by step.

### SECTION 2: Call This Number First! (Rapid Response)

If your loved one was just taken by ICE in the Stockton area, call this number immediately:

**Main Number: (559) 206-0151**

**What happens when you call?**
*   People will come to help.
*   They will write down what happened.
*   They will help you find a lawyer.

These are volunteers. They are on your side. **They will not report you to ICE.**

**Sacramento Backup Number:** (916) 382-0256

**Important:** Do NOT call Bay Area numbers (like 510 or 415 area codes). They are for other cities, not Stockton.

---

### SECTION 3: What is an A-Number? (Read This First!)

Before you can help your loved one, you need to know their "A-Number."

**What is it?**
It is a special number that ICE gives to every person. It is like a case number or a file number.

**What does it look like?**
It is the letter "A" followed by 9 numbers.
Example: **A 123-456-789**

**Where can I find it?**
*   On any old immigration papers they have.
*   On the paper given to them when they were arrested.
*   Sometimes they will call you and tell you the number.

**Why do I need it?**
You cannot find them in the computer system without it. You cannot send them money or letters without it. It is the most key to helping them.

### SECTION 4: How to Find Your Loved One

ICE uses a computer system to keep track of people. You can use this system to find where your loved one is.

**Step 1:** Go to this website: **https://locator.ice.gov/odls/**

**Step 2:** Click on the box that says "Search by A-Number" if you have it. (This is the best way).

**Step 3:** Type in their A-Number and their country of birth.

**Step 4:** If you do NOT have the A-Number, click "Search by Biographical Information." You will need their name, country of birth, and birthday.

**Important Tips regarding the Search:**
*   **Be Patient:** Sometimes it takes **4 to 12 hours** for the name to show up in the system. This is normal. Don't panic.
*   **Try Different Names:** The computer is picky. If they have two last names (like Garcia Lopez), try searching just "Garcia" or just "Lopez" too.
*   **Still Can't Find Them?** If it has been more than 12 hours, call the San Francisco office directly at **(415) 365-8800**. They control Stockton cases.

**If the website doesn't work:**
Call this phone number: **(866) 347-2423**
*   Press 1 for English (or your language).
*   Then press 1 again to use the locator.

### SECTION 6: California Laws That Protect You

You have special rights because you live in California.

**The Police and ICE are Separate (SB 54)**
*   In California, the police are **NOT** allowed to ask you about your immigration papers. This is the law.
*   The police cannot hold you in jail just to give you to ICE.
*   If you are stopped by police, you do **NOT** have to answer questions about where you were born.

**Protection at Work (AB 450)**
*   At work, your boss cannot let ICE into the back areas (like the kitchen or factory floor) without a court paper signed by a judge.
*   If ICE comes to your job, stay calm. Do not run. Ask for a lawyer.

---

### SECTION 7: How to Talk to Your Loved One

**You CANNOT call them directly.**
If you call the facility, they will not pass the phone to your loved one.

**Your loved one has to call YOU.**
They can use phones inside the facility to call you.

**Step 1: Set up a Phone Account**
The calls are not free. You usually have to put money on an account so they can call.
*   Most facilities use a service called "GettingOut."
*   Go to **www.gettingout.com** to make an account.

**Step 2: Sending Messages**
Many facilities give people tablets (like iPads). You can send text messages to them using the same website: **www.gettingout.com**. This is often cheaper and faster than calling.

**Don't worry.** Communication is possible. It just takes a little setup.

---

### SECTION 8: How to Visit

Yes, you can visit your loved one in person. Seeing a friendly face helps them stay strong.

**What to Wear:**
The facilities have strict rules. If you dress "wrong," they might not let you in.
*   Wear simple, modest clothes.
*   Do NOT wear revealing clothes (like tank tops or short skirts).
*   Do NOT wear open-toed shoes (no flip-flops or sandals). Wear sneakers.

**What to Bring:**
*   **Your ID:** A valid government ID (like a driver's license or passport).
*   **Quarters:** Some places have lockers for your keys and phone.

**What NOT to Bring:**
*   Do not bring gifts or food inside.
*   Do not bring anything that could be a weapon.

### SECTION 9: How to Send Money

Your loved one needs money inside for phone calls, snacks, and soap.

*   Or go to **www.JPay.com**

### SECTION 10: What Happens Next? (The Court Process)

Your loved one is in a "Removal Case." The government wants to send them back to their home country. A judge will decide if they can stay.

**There are TWO different courthouses.**
This is confusing for many people. Let us explain.

**1. If your person is STILL in jail:**
*   Their case is at **630 Sansome Street, San Francisco**.
*   **But they will NOT go there.** They will talk to the judge on a TV screen from the jail.
*   **You can go there.** If you want to watch, go to Sansome Street. You will see your loved one on a TV screen. The judge likes to see family there. It shows you care.

**2. If your person got out on bond:**
*   Their case moves to **100 Montgomery Street, San Francisco**.
*   They **DO** have to go there in person.

**How to Find the Court Date**
Call **1-800-898-7180**. You will need their A-Number.

---

### SECTION 11: Can They Get Out While They Wait? (Bond)

"Bond" is like bail. It is money you pay to the court. If you pay it, your loved one can come home while they fight their case.

**Who Can Get Bond?**
The judge decides. They look at:
*   Is this person dangerous?
*   Will this person show up to court?

**How Much Does it Cost?**
It varies. Usually at least $1,500, but can be much higher. You get the money back at the end of the case if they go to all their court dates.

---

### SECTION 12: Finding a Lawyer in Stockton

This is the most important step. **The government does NOT give you a free lawyer.** You have to find one.

Here are organizations in Stockton that help for FREE or low cost:

**1. Catholic Charities of Stockton**
*   **What they do:** They help with court cases, DACA, and becoming a citizen.

*   **What they do:** They specialize in helping people who are in jail. They take hard cases. If other lawyers say no, call them.
*   **Phone:** **(415) 254-0475**

---

### SECTION 13: Your Loved One Has Rights

Even in jail, they have rights.

1.  **Right to Remain Silent:** They do NOT have to answer questions about where they were born.
2.  **Right to Make Calls:** They can call you and look for a lawyer.
3.  **Right to an Interpreter:** If they don't speak English well, they can ask for a translator.
4.  **Do Not Sign:** They should **NEVER sign any paper** they do not understand.

---

### SECTION 14: If ICE Comes to Your Door

If ICE comes to your home, follow these steps to protect your family.

**1. Do NOT open the door.**
Talk through the closed door or a window.

**2. Ask a Question.**
Ask them: "Do you have a paper signed by a **JUDGE**?" (Say the word "judge" clearly).

**3. Check the Paper.**
*   If they say yes, tell them: "Please slide it under the door so I can see it."
*   Look at the paper. Look for the word **"Judge"** or **"Magistrate"** near the signature line.

**4. Make a Decision.**
*   If it does **NOT** say "Judge" or "Magistrate," it is NOT a court paper. You do **NOT** have to open the door.
*   If they only have a paper signed by "ICE" or "DHS," you can say: **"I do not give you permission to come in. Please leave."**

This is legal. This is your right. You are protecting your family.

### SECTION 15: The "Red Folder" - Be Prepared

The best time to prepare is BEFORE anything happens. Make a "Red Folder" now.

Put it somewhere easy to find, like a kitchen drawer. Tell your family where it is.

**What goes in the folder:**
*   **A-Numbers** for everyone in the family who is not a citizen.
*   Copies of **passports, birth certificates, and driver's licenses**.
*   **Medical papers** (especially if someone is sick - this can help get them out).
*   **Marriage papers**.
*   **Kids' school report cards** (to show you are a good parent).
*   A paper that says who will take care of your kids if you are not there. This is called a **Caregiver's Authorization Affidavit**. You do NOT need a lawyer for this.

---

### SECTION 16: You Are Not Alone

There are many people fighting for families like yours.

*   **National Immigrant Justice Center:** [immigrantjustice.org](https://immigrantjustice.org)
*   **ACLU:** [aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org)

**Closing Message:**
Do not lose hope. This is a long road, but you are taking the first steps. By reading this, you are already helping your loved one. Take it one day at a time.

You can do this.
