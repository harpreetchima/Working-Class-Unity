### 1. Introduction & Jurisdiction
This packet is designed to assist families and friends of individuals who have been detained by immigration officials in the San Joaquin County and Stockton, CA area. We understand this is a stressful and frightening time.

**Jurisdiction:**
Stockton falls under the **San Francisco Field Office** for Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO). This office covers San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Calaveras, Tuolumne, Alpine, and Amador counties [1].

*   **SF Field Office Phone:** (415) 365-8800
*   **Email:** SanFrancisco.Outreach@ice.dhs.gov

**You are not alone.** There are resources and organizations dedicated to helping you.

### 2. Rapid Response Network
If a detention has just occurred or is in progress, contact the local Rapid Response Network immediately. They can help verify arrests, dispatch legal observers, and conduct initial family intake.

*   **Valley Watch Rapid Response Network (Primary for San Joaquin County)**
    *   **Hotline:** **(559) 206-0151** [8]
*   **Sacramento Backup:** (916) 382-0256
*   **Important:** Do NOT call Bay Area numbers (area codes 510 or 415) for Stockton cases, as they operate in a different jurisdiction.

### 3. Immediate Steps After Detention
If a loved one has been detained, take these steps immediately:

*   **Get the A-Number:** This is a 9-digit "Alien Registration Number" (e.g., A 123-456-789). It is assigned upon arrest or can be found on prior immigration documents. You will need this for all communication and searches.
*   **Locate the Detainee:**
    *   Use the **ICE Detainee Locator**: [https://locator.ice.gov/odls/#/search](https://locator.ice.gov/odls/#/search)
    *   **Call ICE:** (866) 347-2423 (Select preferred language, then option 1 for detainee locator)
*   **Understanding the Online Locator (ODLS) [19]:**
    *   **Latency:** It typically takes **4 to 12 hours** after an arrest for a record to appear in the system.
    *   **Spelling Matters:** The system is sensitive to spelling and naming conventions. If "No Record" is found, try all variations of the person's name (e.g., maternal last name, hyphens).
    *   **Still No Record?** If no results appear after 12 hours, contact the San Francisco Field Office directly at (415) 365-8800.

*   Phone: **1-800-898-7180**

### 8. Bond Eligibility
*   **Not Guaranteed:** Those with outstanding removal orders, prior deportations, or certain criminal convictions ("mandatory detention") are generally NOT eligible for bond.
*   **Bond Hearing:** If eligible, a detainee can request a bond hearing to ask the judge for a monetary release amount.
*   **Legal Help:** Strongly recommended for bond hearings.

### 9. Finding Legal Help
**Important:** Immigration court does **not** provide free lawyers. However, several local organizations provide low-cost or pro bono assistance.

### 10. Rights of Detained Persons
#### **Warrants: Administrative vs. Judicial [21]**
It is vital to distinguish between the two types of warrants:
*   **Judicial Warrant:** Signed by a judge or magistrate. Grants authority to enter a home.
*   **Administrative Warrant (Form I-200/I-205):** Signed by an ICE supervisor. **Does NOT** grant authority to enter a private home without consent.
*   **Advice:** If ICE comes to your home, ask them to slip the warrant under the door. If it is not signed by a "Judge" or "Magistrate," do **not** open the door.

#### **Other Rights**
*   **Right to Remain Silent:** You do not have to answer questions about birthplace or status.
*   **Right to Call:** Right to call a lawyer or family member.
*   **Do Not Sign:** Do not sign any documents (like "voluntary departure") without a lawyer.

### 11. California Laws Protection
California state laws provide specific protections for immigrants [41], [42]:
*   **SB 54 (California Values Act):** Prohibits local and state law enforcement from asking about immigration status or using resources to assist ICE (with limited exceptions).
*   **AB 450:** Prohibits employers from allowing ICE into non-public areas of a workplace without a judicial warrant.

### 12. Gather Important Documents (The "Red Folder")
We recommend families prepare a "Red Folder" containing critical documents in case of emergency [43]:
*   **A-Numbers** for all non-citizen family members.
*   **Identity Documents:** Copies of passports, birth certificates, driver's licenses.
*   **Medical Records:** Essential for requesting humanitarian parole if detained.
*   **Marriage Certificates & Children's School Records:** To prove family ties.
*   **Form G-28:** If an attorney has already been retained.
*   **Caregiver’s Authorization Affidavit:** Allows a relative to care for children without going to court.
*   **Power of Attorney:** For financial matters (must be notarized **BEFORE** detention).

### 13. How to Help from Outside
*   **Secure Legal Representation:** This is the priority.
*   **Send Money:** Via the facility's approved vendor (JailATM, CorrectPay, etc.).
*   **Write Letters:** Include the A-Number on the envelope. Do not discuss case details.
*   **Stay in Contact:** Regular communication improves morale.

### 14. Report Raids
If you witness ICE activity:
*   **Document Details:** Time, location, license plates, officer descriptions.
*   **Call the Hotline:** **(559) 206-0151** (Valley Watch) or **1-855-HELP-MY-FAMILY**.
