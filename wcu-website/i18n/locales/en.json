Fighting each other over crumbs to cover the costs for healthcare, housing, and survival has always been a fools game. The labor movement's slogan \"an injury to one is an injury to all\" remains true. We understand when immigrant workers are targeted, the wages, well-being, and power of every worker are weakened.",

The same ruling class then blames immigrants for crises caused by corporate greed, hoping to fracture the working class and keep wages low. When undocumented workers are kept in fear, employers can threaten deportation to crush organizing and drive down pay. That hurts the entirety of the working class. The answer is not to turn on each other; the answer is to unite and fight the bosses together."

Democrats offer kinder words but have presided over mass deportations and expanded enforcement, while leaving working-class cities to shoulder costs of migration without support. The result is predictable: people already struggling with housing and services are pitted against new arrivals for resources neither group should have to fight over. We reject the propaganda that our only choices are one party's cruelty or the other's empty promises. We build independent, organized working-class power."
