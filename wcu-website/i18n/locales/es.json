Cuando se les infunde a los trabajadores indocumentados con miedo, los patrones pueden amenazar con la deportación para aplastar los esfuerzos de organización y bajar los salarios.

Los demócratas ofrecen palabras más amables, pero han presidido deportaciones masivas y aumentado el control migratorio, mientras dejan que las ciudades de clase obrera carguen con los costos de la migración sin ningún apoyo. El resultado es predecible: la gente que ya tiene dificultades con la vivienda y los servicios es puesta a competir contra los recién llegados por recursos por los que ningún grupo debería tener que pelear.
